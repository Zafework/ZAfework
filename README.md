### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student with a dream to make a significant impact in my country, a developing nation in Africa.  I came up with a small plan on how to impact my country directly. My basic goal is to develop an identity protection software as well as means to accumulate necessary data to reduce bureaucracy and corruption. I believe we all know the level of bureaucracy and corruption in many developing nations. I'm seeking recommendations on the most suitable programming languages for my project. My focus is on a language that would be apt for handling identity protection and efficient data management.
Any suggestions or guidance would be immensely appreciated.
